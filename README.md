# User-management
This App contains 2 folders one for UI and one for API.
Core Features: 
1. Dynamic API Integration: - Fetch the initial mock data with an API call (developed in a framework of your choice e.g. fastAPI, 
flask) and display it in a table on the left-hand side of the screen. - The right-hand side of the screen will feature a form for entering user data: Name, Surname, and 
Email address. 
2. User Input Form: - Use a unique identifier to each record in the table to manipulate the records - Create a form to create new users or edit existing ones - Include validation to ensure all fields are filled and the email address is in the correct format. 
3. Responsive Layout: - Design a responsive layout where the table and form are side by side on larger screens and stack 
vertically on smaller screens. 
4. State Updates: - Use state management effectively to handle the updates without reloading the page.
